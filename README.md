# Fettle
Fettle is an innovative solution designed to ensure fair resource management among students and prevent unregulated "first come, first serve" rules in college sports. This idea has been recognized and awarded in prestigious events like the Erudite Ideathon (3rd prize) and BVMI Hackathon (Top 25).


## Features
- **Book Sports Court:** Fettle enables students to pre-book sports services available in colleges by bidding points received from the university on a weekly basis. This approach ensures that students have a fair chance to access sports facilities.
- **Exclusive Lock for Colleges:** Colleges have the option to reserve a sports court for a particular day or event, ensuring that no other student can bid for it during that time.
- **Moderators for Fair Play:** To maintain fairness, Fettle allows students to report any instances where rules are not being followed properly. Students can record a video and provide a drive link for further action.
- **Rating System for Students:** Fettle implements a rating system based on students' gameplay performance. These ratings can be used to create balanced teams and promote fair team selection.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend: **The frontend of Fettle is developed using pure HTML CSS and Javascript.
- **Backend:** For the backend, Fettle utilizes Node.js and Express.js to handle requests, manage user data, and facilitate communication with the database.
- **Database: **MongoDB is used as the primary database to store user information, court availability, ratings, and other essential data.
